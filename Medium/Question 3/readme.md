As usual Leonard is being mocked by Sheldon for being the stupidest person in his house and to prove this he gives Leonard a task. He gives Leonard a string S, and leonard is  allowed to choose exactly one substring from S and shift all its characters 1 backward. Example- ‘a’->’z, ‘c’->'b' , ‘z’->’y’ and so on. He is allowed to perform this operation only once and have to find out the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from S. Can you help Leonard?

### Input
First line contains the number of test cases T. Then T line follows, each containing a string S.
### Output format
For every test Case print the lexicographically minimum string in a separate line.
